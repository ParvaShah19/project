Here's a modified description tailored to a project made using Django:  

---

This file is created by Parva shah, MBA Tech. Computer Engineering student from MPSTME. This is a short project for representing a professor login portal with the following functionalities:  

1. **Adding Students**  
2. **Removing Students**  
3. **Marking Students as Absent or Present**  
4. **Viewing Monthly Attendance Reports** (Present and Absent)  

### Steps to Run the Code  
This project is developed using Django with manual functionalities. Follow these steps to set it up:  
1. Install all dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
2. Run all the necessary database migrations using the command `python manage.py migrate`.  
3. Start the development server using `python manage.py runserver`.  

### Project Structure  
- **Frontend**: The templates for the login and dashboard are located in the `templates` folder, with styling managed through the `static` folder.  
- **Backend**: All backend logic is implemented in the Django app structure with models, views, and URLs configured in the main application folder.  
- **Database**: SQLite is used for simplicity, and the student roll number serves as the primary key, ensuring uniqueness.  

### How It Works  
- The login page (`login.html`) accepts a predefined username and password:  
  - **Username**: `admin`  
  - **Password**: `admin`  
- Upon successful login, users are redirected to the dashboard (`dashboard.html`), which displays all functionalities like adding/removing students, marking attendance, and viewing reports.  

### Technologies Used  
The project incorporates several technologies, including:  
- **Django**: For backend development  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For building the frontend interface  
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design  
- **SQLite**: As the database  

### Additional Details  
The roll number acts as the unique identifier throughout the project and is pivotal in managing student data.  

The **README**  folder contain documentation  of how the website appears and functions.  

This project was designed to simplify attendance management for professors while providing an intuitive user experience.
